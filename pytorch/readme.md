## What is PyTorch?

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a framework that contains lots of modules to support machine learning and deep learning workloads. You can use PyTorch to train neural networks to [classify images](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html), [do object detection](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html) all the way through to [classfiying text](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html) (which is the focus of this tutorial) and many, many more. It is well-integrated into Python (that programming language that has 'snaked' its way through to becoming one of the most popular languages used in data science and machine learning) and is designed to train models on GPU and CPU machines. 

## How do I get started?
You need to install PyTorch of course! But before you can do that, you need to make sure you have the following installed: 
> [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (preferrably Python 3.x where x is a variable so just replace x with a number)

> [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) (not to be confused with Nicki Minaj's song, Anaconda is a package manager, environment manager and a Python data science distribution. When you install Anaconda, you get an Anaconda promote and the Anaconda Navigator which allows you to install a LOT of Anaconda packages for free.)
