## How to use this guide: 

The tutorial is split into 3 sections, the frontend tier with React, the middle tier with Django, the backend tier with Pytorch. Each section takes you through a simple tutorial on how to leverage open-source technologies to build an end-to-end machine learning solution. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will show you how to build an application that can classify texts but the aim of this tutorial is to act as a template for any machine learning solutions, models, and packages that can be easily consumed by applications. 

## Part 1: React App

To create and start your React App, do the following below:

### npx create-react-app my-app
### cd my-app
### npm start

## Part 2: Django APIs
...

## Part 3: PyTorch Model
...

**NOTE** Ensure you have python interpreter in your system. visit https://www.python.org/downloads/

### clone the project

create a virtual environment run this command pip install virtualenv in your termital, make sure your in the project directory SVM_API run this command virtual env this will create a folder called env activate the virtual enviroment by running this env\scripts\activate

python pakages in your virtual enviroment run pip install django djangorestframework

navigate to the svm folder by running cd svm

then run python manage.py runserver
